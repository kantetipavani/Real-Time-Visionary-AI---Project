# Real-Time-Visionary-AI---Project
This project is a real-time object detection system built with YOLO and TensorFlow.js to assist visually impaired individuals. It captures live video, detects objects instantly, and provides audio feedback using Text-to-Speech. The system acts as ‘eyes that speak,’ enabling safer and more independent navigation.
